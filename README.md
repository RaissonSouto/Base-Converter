# bin2dec 

This is an atempt to create a base converter using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react). It's inspired by another project called [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas), which suggest some creative ideas of apps to practice new skills/technologys instead the good old "to do list". The original idea is to make a simple binary to decimal translator, however, I decided to make something like a google translate for number and their number bases.
