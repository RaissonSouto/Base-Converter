# bin2dec 

This is an atempt to create a base converter using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react). It's inspired by another project called [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas), which suggest some creative ideas of apps to practice new skills/technologys instead the good old "to do list". The original idea is to make a simple binary to decimal translator, however, I decided to make something like a google translate for number and their number bases.

- bin2bin (In bin2dec, the program translate a number in some base to the same number but in another base. In bin2bin (I didn't find in a better name), the idea is to translate this binary to another binary represetation (like two's complement, excess-128, etc))
